## What is password pusher and for what does it stand for?

Password Pusher is a tool used for sharing securely passwords and other sensitive information.
You can create a unique, one-time URL that will expire after a certain amount of time, 
or after it has been accessed a certain number of times via Password Pusher.
Once expired passwords, are unequivocally deleted.

Application is a better alternative to emailing passwords.
It avoids having passwords exist in email archives in perpetuity. It does not exist as an end-all security solution.

By default, the  Password Pusher is set to expire and delete secret link after 1 day and 1 view.
A 1-click retrieval step is also enabled to avoid chat systems and URL scanners from eating up views.
You can always change those setting if you need, however it is advised to use the default settings in most cases.
