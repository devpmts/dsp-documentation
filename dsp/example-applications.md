[&larr; back to Overview](/)

The Digital Solution Platform (DSP) provides a example applications to illustrate how GitOps can streamline processes.

We have two ready examples:
- A monolithic Java application based on [Spring Petclinic](https://github.com/Digital-Solution-Platform/gitops-digital-solution-platform/tree/main/apps/spring-petclinic).
- A composite microservice-based application called [Service Tracker](https://github.com/Digital-Solution-Platform/gitops-digital-solution-platform/tree/main/apps/service-tracker).

These application showcase key patterns and best practices
for deploying and managing cloud-native services.
